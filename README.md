# Introduction
This eslint plugin is used to force developers to use  `{ deletedAt: null }` filter in where query.

# Motivation
Prisma does have easy support for implementing soft delete, but it is not as neat as other ORMs out there. You can follow [this guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/middleware/soft-delete-middleware) to implement soft-delete using Prisma. The problem is you have to add `{ deleted: null }` or `{ deletedAt: null }` filter explicitly when querying for data. It is very easy to make mistakes for new teammates if it goes without review in big teams. Hence, this plugin.

# Installation
## npm
```shell
npm i -D eslint-plugin-prisma-soft-delete
```
## yarn
```shell
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-prisma-soft-delete
```

```javascript
// .eslintrc
module.exports = {
